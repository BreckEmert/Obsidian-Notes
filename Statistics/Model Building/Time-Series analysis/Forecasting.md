Forecasting is a technique that uses historical data as inputs to make informed estimates that are **predictive** in determining the direction of future trends.

Businesses use forecasting to determine how to allocate their **budgets** or plan for anticipated **expenses** for an upcoming period of time.  This is typically based on the projected **demand** for the goods and services.
