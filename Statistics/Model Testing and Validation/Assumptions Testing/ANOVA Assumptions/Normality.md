## Blom's Normal Scores
### What Are Blom's Normal Scores?

Blom’s Normal Scores are a method for calculating quantiles in a way that better approximates the normal distribution, especially in small sample sizes. They are used in quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots, which help assess whether a dataset approximates a normal distribution.

- **Standard Quantiles vs. Blom’s Method**:
  - **Without Blom**: Typically, Q-Q plots use the quantiles $\frac{q}{N+1}$ to compare sample data against the theoretical normal distribution. However, this method can be overly sensitive to extreme values (the smallest and largest data points), particularly in small samples.
  - **Blom’s Normal Scores**: Blom (1958) proposed a refined method for calculating quantiles using:
    $$ \zeta_q = \Psi^{-1}\left[\frac{q - 0.375}{N + 0.25}\right] $$
    where $\zeta_q$ is the normal score for the $q$th quantile, $\Psi^{-1}$ is the inverse of the standard normal CDF, $q$ is the rank, and $N$ is the total number of observations.
  
- **Rationale**: Blom’s method adjusts the ranks, reducing the influence of extreme values and providing a more accurate reflection of the normal distribution, particularly for smaller datasets.

### Why Use Blom's Normal Scores?

1. **Improved Approximation**:
   - **Small Sample Sizes**: Blom’s method mitigates issues with traditional quantiles that can distort the Q-Q plot, making it seem as though the data deviates from normality more than it does.
   - **Edge Cases**: By smoothing the impact of extreme values, Blom’s method results in a Q-Q plot that more accurately reflects the true distribution of the data.

2. **Q-Q Plots**:
   - **Visual Representation**: Blom’s scores help Q-Q plots align more closely with the diagonal line if the data is normally distributed, making it easier to visually assess normality.
   - **Reliability**: The Q-Q plot with Blom’s adjustment is a more trustworthy tool for determining normality, especially with smaller sample sizes.

### Summary

Blom’s normal scores improve the reliability of Q-Q plots in assessing normality, particularly for small samples. By adjusting quantiles to reduce the impact of extreme values, Blom’s method ensures that the Q-Q plot more accurately represents whether the data follows a normal distribution, leading to better statistical inferences.
